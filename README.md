# GooglePoliticalTransparencyReoportCleaning
This script exists to clean and narrow the google political ads transparency report corpus down to protrump organizations for future analysis.

The data corpus can be found here: https://transparencyreport.google.com/political-ads/region/US

Some tweaking will need to be done to the script.  Specifically you will need to enter the correct filepath to the .csv as well as where you want the cleaned .csv to go.
